# 4. Explain the use of in operator and slicing with examples. How is it different from indexing? 

   # we can use "in" operator check the condition and value is exits or not in the same condition.

# use of "in" operator
list = [1, 32, 5, 7]
print("This is used of in operator:",32 in list)

     # slicing is extracting a part of string.   
# use of slice 
word="Python"
print("Slice the word:",word[0:6])

      # indexing is process of extraing a single element from sequence. 
  # "in" operator can't use indexing but slice we use to excess a single value or element. 

word = "Programming"
print("Accessing the value by using index:",word[0])
