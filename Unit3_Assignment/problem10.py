# Imagine you’re creating a student management system. Identify which data structure (list, tuple, dictionary, or set) would be best for storing:
            # • Student names list
            # • Immutable student ID   tuple
            # • Student-course mapping  dictionary
            # • List of unique subjects   set
#Explain why each structure is suitable. 

# using list for collect student names 
student_names = ["Gaurav", "Kartik", "karan", "Samrat"]

# using tuple for immutable student ID
student_Id = (1, 2, 3, 4)

# using dictionary for mapping student-course
student_course = {
   1 : ["Digital Logic", "C++"], 
   2: ["Computer Science", "Research"],
   3: 
}
