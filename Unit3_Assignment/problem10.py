# Imagine you’re creating a student management system. Identify which data structure (list, tuple, dictionary, or set) would be best for storing:
        # • Student names
        # • Immutable student ID
        # • Student-course mapping
        # • List of unique subjects
#Explain why each structure is suitable.
